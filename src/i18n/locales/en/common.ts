        2: {
          question: "Do I need technical skills?",
          answer:
            "Not at all! FeastQR is designed for restaurant owners, not developers. Our step-by-step onboarding guides you through everything. If you can use WhatsApp, you can use FeastQR.",

        3: {
          question: "Which languages are supported?",
          answer:
            "FeastQR supports English, French, and Arabic with full right-to-left (RTL) support. Your menu automatically adapts to each language, making it perfect for Morocco's multilingual market. AI-powered auto-translation helps you reach all your customers.",

        5: {
          question: "How do QR codes work?",
          answer:
            "We generate unique QR codes for your restaurant that link directly to your digital menu. Print them for table tents, receipts, or window displays. Customers scan with their phone camera — no special app needed.",

          question: "Can I customize the design?",
          answer:
            "Yes! Choose from multiple themes, customize colors and fonts, upload your logo, and make your menu match your brand perfectly. Our theme editor gives you a live preview so you can see changes instantly.",

          question: "Is my data secure?",
          answer:

          answer:
            "Unlike Glovo (which charges up to 30% commission on every order), FeastQR charges ZERO commission. You keep 100% of your revenue. Plus, you own your customer relationships and data. No middleman, no hidden fees.",
