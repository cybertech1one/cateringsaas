**Yassir**
- Algerian origin, expanding in Morocco
- Food delivery + ride-hailing
- Promises delivery in under 35 minutes

#### Tier 3: Exited / Declining

**Jumia Food** -- SHUT DOWN December 2023
- Exited food delivery across 7 African markets including Morocco
- Cited "deep-pocketed aggressive rivals" (i.e., Glovo)
- Jumia continues in Morocco for physical goods/JumiaPay only
- This exit created market opportunity that remains partially unfilled

### 1.3 Consumer Demographics and Behavior

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Internet users (2025) | 35.3M (92.2% penetration) |
| E-commerce users (2025) | 8M+ (~21.6% of population) |
| Online shoppers growth (5yr) | +65% (3.7M new shoppers) |
| Mobile web traffic share | 55% |
| Desktop web traffic share | 44% |
| Urban delivery app usage (monthly) | 74% use at least one app |
| Weekly food ordering frequency | 25% order at least once/week |
| Platform usage: Glovo | 58% |
| Platform usage: Jumia Food (pre-exit) | 41% |
| Key demographic for delivery | 18-24 year olds (49% adoption) |
| Overall delivery app penetration | ~25% of all Moroccans |
| "One in seven" Moroccans | Use Glovo specifically |

**Consumer behavior insights:**
- Mobile-first is the norm (55% mobile traffic)
- Strong preference for local cuisine and traditional dishes
- Younger demographics drive adoption and seek healthier options
- Convenience is the primary driver -- busy urban lifestyles
- Price sensitivity is high -- promotional offers drive platform choice
- Social commerce is growing (Facebook Marketplace, Instagram Shops)

### 1.4 Average Order Values, Delivery Fees, Tipping

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ARPU (annual per user) | ~US$52.91 (~530 MAD) |
| Estimated average order value | 50-80 MAD (~$5-8) based on market data |
| Delivery fees | Distance-based, varies by platform |
| Glovo base delivery fee | Approximately 10-15 MAD for short distance |
| Tipping culture | Not deeply embedded; digital tips rare |
| Restaurant avg online sales increase | +25% via delivery platforms |

**Key insight:** Average order values in Morocco are significantly lower than European markets. This means margins per delivery are thin, making operational efficiency critical.

## 2. Driver/Courier Reality in Morocco

### 2.1 Driver Demographics

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Total Glovo couriers in Morocco | 4,500 |
| Typical age range | 18-35 (predominantly young men) |
| Education | Mix of students and low-skilled workers |
| Primary vehicle | Motorcycles and scooters (~90%) |
| Secondary vehicles | Bicycles (urban core), cars (rare) |
| Employment status | Self-employed (auto-entrepreneur) |
| Working hours | Flexible, but most work 10-12 hours/day |

### 2.2 Current Earnings

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Glovo base rate per delivery | 6 MAD (~$0.60 / EUR 0.55) |
| Estimated deliveries per hour | 2-4 |
| Estimated hourly gross earnings | 12-24 MAD ($1.20-2.40) |
| General courier monthly salary range (Morocco) | 5,200-23,700 MAD |
| Median courier monthly income | 10,300 MAD |
| Common range (65th percentile) | 6,610-10,600 MAD |
| Minimum wage comparison (Jan 2025) | 3,269 MAD/month (17.10 MAD/hour) |

**Critical context:** The 6 MAD base rate per delivery is a major pain point. Riders bear ALL operational costs:
- Motorcycle purchase/lease
- Fuel
- Mobile data
- Vehicle maintenance
- Insurance (if any)
- Phone/equipment

After expenses, many riders report net earnings below minimum wage. This was the core grievance in the September 2025 strike.

### 2.3 Rider Demands (from 2025 Strike)

1. Immediate increase in base rate
2. Double night delivery rates (evening risk premium)
3. Double pay + compensation during national/religious holidays
4. Full payment for cancelled orders
5. End the "grouped orders" system
6. Algorithms that respect traffic laws and health/safety standards
7. Reactivation of arbitrarily blocked/suspended accounts
8. Prohibition of unexplained account suspensions

### 2.4 Existing Driver Pools to Recruit From

| Source | Estimated Size | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Glovo riders (dissatisfied) | 4,500 | Many striking; open to alternatives |
| Informal delivery workers | 10,000+ | Restaurants with own delivery staff |
| Students | Large pool | Part-time, flexible hours |
| Yassir/InDriver drivers | Unknown | Ride-hailing drivers seeking additional income |
| Motorcycle courier services | Thousands | Traditional document/package couriers |

### 2.5 Labor Regulations for Gig Workers

**Auto-entrepreneur status (primary framework):**
- Revenue cap: MAD 200,000/year for services, MAD 500,000 for goods
- Tax: 0.5% (commercial/industrial) or 1% (services) flat rate on turnover
- Social protection: Mandatory AMO (health) + CNSS (pension) contributions
- Registration: Requires only CNI (national identity card)
- VAT: Exempt below thresholds
- No paid leave provisions by law
- Workers are legally independent, not employees

**Key risk:** Morocco's labor code (Code du Travail) does not have specific gig economy legislation. The auto-entrepreneur framework is used by default, but there is growing pressure (as seen in the Glovo strike) for better protections. Spain forced Glovo to hire 60,000 delivery workers as employees in 2024 -- Morocco could follow.

### 2.6 Driver Verification Requirements

| Document | Purpose | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| CNIE (Carte Nationale d'Identite Electronique) | Primary identity verification, biometric NFC card | DGSN |
| Driver's license (Permis de conduire) | Vehicle operation authorization | Ministry of Equipment |
| Vehicle registration card (Carte grise) | Vehicle ownership/authorization | Ministry of Equipment |
| Vehicle insurance certificate | Mandatory civil liability | Insurance company |
| Auto-entrepreneur registration | Tax/legal status | Barid Al-Maghrib / CNSS |
| Criminal record extract (Casier judiciaire) | Background check | Tribunal |
| Bank account / mobile wallet | Payment settlement | Bank/fintech |

### 2.7 Common Fraud and Scam Patterns

| Fraud Type | Description | Mitigation |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| GPS spoofing | Faking location to appear closer to orders or complete deliveries without traveling | Device fingerprinting, location intelligence, tamper detection |
| Fake delivery completion | Marking orders as delivered without actual delivery | Photo proof of delivery, customer confirmation |
| Cash theft | Collecting COD payment and not remitting to platform | Daily settlement caps, COD limits, progressive trust system |
| Multi-accounting | Creating multiple rider accounts for bonus farming | KYC verification, device fingerprinting, biometric checks |
| Account selling/sharing | Selling verified accounts to unverified individuals | Periodic selfie verification, biometric spot checks |
| Collusion with restaurants | Fake orders to generate revenue | Order pattern analysis, anomaly detection |
| Delivery interception | Third party intercepting food before customer | Real-time tracking, OTP verification at delivery |

## 3. Payment Systems in Morocco

### 3.1 Payment Method Landscape

| Payment Method | Penetration/Usage | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Cash on delivery (COD) | 60-74% of e-commerce transactions | Dominant method; 66% of consumers still depend on cash |
| Bank cards (CMI network) | 17% of online transactions | Growing; 7.9M online card transactions in 2023 |
| Mobile wallets | 6% possession rate, 2% of non-cash transactions | 13.8M accounts but only 28% active |
| BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) | 74% awareness, 39% willing to adopt | Emerging; Chari is local innovator |
| Apple Pay / Google Pay | Launched 2023 | Early adoption; CIH Bank among first supporters |

**Critical insight:** COD dominance (60-74%) means Diyafa MUST support cash-on-delivery as the primary payment method. Any platform that forces digital-only payments will lose the majority of the market.

### 3.2 Mobile Payment Providers

| Provider | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Inwi Money | Telco wallet | First mobile payment service in Morocco; financial inclusion focus |
| Cash Plus | Agent network + digital | Partnered with PayPal (Sep 2025); MAD withdrawals |
| Orange Money | Telco wallet | Wide agent network |
| M-Wallet | Bank mobile wallet | BAM-regulated |
| WafaCash | Bank-linked | Attijariwafa subsidiary |
| CIH Pay | Bank digital payment | Early Apple/Google Pay adopter |
| NAPS (Naps) | Fintech payment | Emerging challenger after CMI monopoly breakup |

### 3.3 Payment Gateway Options

| Gateway | Suitability for Diyafa | Notes |
|---------|------------------------|-------|
| **CMI (Centre Monetique Interbancaire)** | Primary -- MUST integrate | Leading gateway; Visa/Mastercard/local cards; 3D Secure 2 mandatory; SHA512 authentication |
| **Payzone** | Secondary | User-friendly; good for SMEs; supports mobile wallets |
| **HPS Switch** | Infrastructure layer | National payment hub connecting banks; not direct integration |
| **CIH Pay** | Supplementary | Digital wallet payments |
| **Maroc Telecommerce** | Alternative acquirer | Alternative to CMI after monopoly breakup (May 2025) |
| **Stripe** | NOT available in Morocco | Requires foreign entity (e.g., EU subsidiary) |
| **PayPal** | Limited | Withdrawal only via Cash Plus; not suitable for marketplace |

**CMI Integration specifics:**
- Merchant account setup: 2-4 weeks via Attijariwafa Bank
- Credentials: Client ID + Store Key
- Security: SHA512 hash (parameters sorted alphabetically + Store Key, hashed, then base64 encoded)
- Callbacks: Server-to-server HTTPS
- 3D Secure 2: Mandatory for Moroccan cards
- Tokenization supported (no direct card storage)
- Mobile payments: USSD, QR code, NFC supported
- Development budget: 30K-80K MAD for complete integration
- Development time: 5-15 developer days

### 3.4 Cash-on-Delivery Management

**The COD problem for delivery platforms:**
Since 60-74% of orders will be COD, managing driver cash collection and settlement is a critical operational challenge.

**Recommended COD settlement model:**
1. **Daily cash reconciliation** -- Drivers must settle cash at end of each shift
2. **Digital settlement points** -- Partner with Cash Plus / WafaCash agent networks for driver cash deposits
3. **Cash caps** -- Limit maximum COD value a driver can carry (e.g., 500 MAD)
4. **Progressive trust** -- New drivers get lower COD limits; increase with trust score
5. **Cash-out via mobile wallet** -- Enable drivers to deposit cash and transfer to platform via Inwi Money / Cash Plus
6. **Insurance/bond** -- Consider requiring refundable deposit from drivers handling COD

### 3.5 BAM (Bank Al-Maghrib) Regulatory Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| License type | Payment institution or money transfer company approval |
| Security standard | PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance |
| Audits | Annual security audits mandatory |
| KYC/AML | Full implementation required |
| Infrastructure | High-availability (AWS/Azure) |
| VAT | Standard rate 20%; auto-entrepreneurs exempt below threshold |
| Data localization | Processing of Moroccan payment data subject to BAM oversight |

**Key consideration:** If Diyafa acts as a marketplace holding and disbursing funds, it may need payment institution licensing from BAM. Alternative: Partner with a licensed payment institution to handle the fund flow.

## 4. Driver Management & Algorithms

### 4.1 Driver Onboarding Verification (KYC)

**Required documents (Morocco-specific):**

| Step | Process | Verification Method |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 1. Identity | CNIE capture (front/back) | OCR + NFC chip read (CNIe biometric) |
| 2. Selfie match | Live photo vs. CNIE photo | Facial recognition (liveness detection) |
| 3. Driver's license | Photo capture + validation | OCR + database check |
| 4. Vehicle registration | Carte grise photo | OCR verification |
| 5. Insurance | Valid insurance certificate | Manual review + expiry tracking |
| 6. Criminal record | Casier judiciaire extract | Manual upload + review |
| 7. Auto-entrepreneur | Registration proof | Manual upload |
| 8. Bank/wallet | Bank account or mobile wallet | Test micro-deposit |
| 9. Vehicle inspection | Photo of vehicle (multiple angles) | Manual review |

**KYC providers available in Morocco:**
- Smile ID (digital identity verification)
- uqudo (KYC/AML services for Morocco)
- ID Analyzer (validates Moroccan CIN, driver license, passport)
- Shufti Pro (KYC & AML Morocco)
- Dojah (comprehensive KYC)

**Record retention:** Minimum 10 years after relationship ends (Law No. 12-18).

### 4.2 Order Assignment Algorithm

**Recommended multi-factor scoring model:**

```
driver_score = w1 * proximity_score
             + w2 * performance_score
             + w3 * availability_score
             + w4 * vehicle_match_score
             + w5 * earnings_fairness_score
```

**Factor breakdown:**

| Factor | Weight | Calculation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Proximity | 35% | Haversine distance to restaurant; penalize >3km |
| Performance | 25% | Completion rate, avg delivery time, customer rating |
| Availability | 15% | Time since last order, shift duration, fatigue score |
| Vehicle match | 10% | Order size vs vehicle capacity; hot/cold requirements |
| Earnings fairness | 15% | Distribute orders to prevent earning disparities |

**Queue-based fallback:**
If no driver accepts within 60 seconds, expand radius by 1km increments up to 8km max, then escalate to manual dispatch.

**Morocco-specific considerations:**
- Traffic congestion in Casablanca (especially Route de Mediouna, Ain Sebaa) requires real-time traffic-aware ETA
- Medina areas (Marrakech, Fes) are partially pedestrian -- need walking/bicycle routing
- Prayer times (especially Friday Dhuhr) reduce driver availability
- Ramadan shifts eating patterns dramatically (iftar surge at sunset)

### 4.3 Surge Pricing / Dynamic Pricing

**Recommended approach for Morocco:**

| Demand Level | Multiplier | Trigger |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Normal | 1.0x | Supply/demand ratio > 0.7 |
| Elevated | 1.2x | Supply/demand ratio 0.5-0.7 |
| High | 1.5x | Supply/demand ratio 0.3-0.5 |
| Very High | 1.8x | Supply/demand ratio < 0.3 |
| Maximum cap | 2.0x | Hard ceiling to prevent backlash |

**Morocco considerations:**
- Price sensitivity is HIGH -- surge must be transparent and capped
- Glovo's Competition Council settlement bars "excessively low pricing" -- dynamic pricing must not constitute predatory pricing either
- Consumer trust is fragile in emerging markets; abusive surge will drive users to competitors or back to phone ordering
- Consider showing estimated wait time WITHOUT surge as alternative ("Wait 45min for normal price or pay 1.5x for 20min delivery")

### 4.4 Driver Rating and Quality Scoring

**Composite driver quality score (0-100):**

| Metric | Weight | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Delivery completion rate | 25% | Orders completed / orders accepted |
| On-time delivery rate | 20% | Delivered within estimated window |
| Customer rating (1-5) | 20% | Rolling 50-order average |
| Order acceptance rate | 15% | Orders accepted / orders offered |
| Restaurant rating | 10% | Feedback from pickup point |
| Safety score | 10% | Speed violations, accident reports |

**Thresholds:**
- Score > 80: Priority order assignment, bonus eligibility
- Score 60-80: Standard assignment
- Score 40-60: Warning, reduced assignment priority
- Score < 40: Account review, potential suspension

### 4.5 Anti-Fraud Systems

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Device fingerprinting | SHIELD / Fingerprint.js | Detect multi-accounting, account sharing |
| Location intelligence | Radar.io / Incognia | Detect GPS spoofing, location anomalies |
| Behavioral analytics | Custom ML model | Detect unusual patterns (impossible routes, speed anomalies) |
| Photo proof of delivery | In-app camera with metadata | Verify actual delivery occurred |
| OTP at delivery | SMS/WhatsApp code | Customer confirms receipt for high-value orders |
| Periodic selfie check | Biometric verification | Confirm account holder is the active driver |
| Cash reconciliation | Automated daily settlement | Flag discrepancies between COD collected and deposited |
| ML anomaly detection | Custom model | Flag suspicious order patterns, collusion signals |

### 4.6 Driver Incentive Programs

**Programs proven effective in emerging markets:**

| Incentive Type | Description | Expected Impact |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Streak bonuses | Complete X orders in Y hours for bonus | +20-30% order completion |
| Peak hour premiums | Extra MAD per delivery during 12-14h, 19-22h | +40% driver availability at peaks |
| Weekly earnings guarantee | Minimum guaranteed if X orders completed | Reduces driver churn |
| Referral bonuses | Bonus for recruiting new drivers | Organic driver acquisition |
| Safety bonuses | Monthly bonus for zero incidents | Reduced insurance liability |
| Ramadan special | Enhanced rates during iftar hours | Maintains coverage during critical period |
| Level-up system | Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond tiers with perks | Long-term retention |
| Scholarship fund | Modeled on Glovo's MAD 5M annual impact fund | Differentiation + social impact PR |

| Agadir | 5-8km | More spread out; less traffic |
| Meknes | 4-6km | Moderate density |
| Kenitra | 4-6km | Growing city; good road infrastructure |

### 5.2 Delivery Time Expectations

| Service Level | Target Time | Premium |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Express | <25 minutes | +50% delivery fee |
| Standard | 25-40 minutes | Base delivery fee |
| Economy | 40-60 minutes | Reduced fee / free with minimum order |

**Benchmarks:**
- Yassir Morocco promises under 35 minutes
- Glovo targets under 1 hour but typically delivers in 30-45 minutes
- Consumer expectation in urban Morocco: 30-45 minutes is acceptable

### 5.3 Peak Hour Management

| Peak Period | Hours | Demand Level | Strategy |
|-------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Lunch rush | 12:00-14:00 | Very High | Pre-position drivers near restaurant clusters |
| Post-work snacking | 17:00-18:00 | Moderate | Incentivize early shift starts |
| Dinner prime | 19:00-22:00 | Very High | Full fleet activation + surge pricing |
| Late night | 22:00-01:00 | Moderate | Night premium for drivers |
| Friday prayer/post-prayer | 12:30-14:30 | Low then spike | Reduced capacity then surge |
| Ramadan iftar | Sunset +/- 1hr | Extreme | All-hands; pre-staged deliveries; batch cooking partnerships |
| Weekend brunch | 10:00-13:00 (Sat/Sun) | High | Bonus incentives |

### 5.4 Vehicle Requirements

| Vehicle Type | Use Case | Requirements |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Motorcycle/scooter | Primary (90% of deliveries) | Valid registration, insurance, helmet, thermal bag |
| Bicycle | Medina zones, short distance | Thermal bag, phone mount |
| Car | Bad weather, bulk orders | Valid registration, insurance, thermal bags |

**Thermal bag specifications:**
- Insulated food delivery bag (minimum 35L capacity)
- Separate hot/cold compartments
- Waterproof exterior
- Reflective strips for night visibility
- Platform-branded (Diyafa branding opportunity)

### 5.5 Hot/Cold Chain Management

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Hot food maintenance | Insulated thermal bags with heat retention lining |
| Cold items | Separate insulated compartment with ice packs |
| Maximum transit time | 45 minutes from restaurant to customer |
| Temperature monitoring | Spot checks + customer feedback |
| Packaging standards | Sealed, tamper-evident containers (restaurant responsibility) |
| Beverage spillage | Upright carrier inserts, cup holders in bags |

### 5.6 Multi-Drop Optimization

**Batching rules:**
- Maximum 2 orders per batch (to maintain quality)
- Both pickups must be within 500m of each other
- Both deliveries must be within 2km of each other
- Maximum 15-minute delay to any single order from batching
- Customer must be informed of batched delivery with updated ETA

**Note from Glovo context:** The "grouped orders" system was a major complaint from riders (reducing per-delivery earnings). If implementing multi-drop, ensure driver pay is per-delivery, not per-trip.

## 6. Regulatory & Legal

### 6.1 Platform Regulations

| Area | Regulation | Implication for Diyafa |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| Competition law | Competition Council actively enforcing | Cannot impose exclusivity on restaurants; commissions scrutinized |
| Commission caps | Glovo settlement precedent: 30% maximum | Industry benchmark now set |
| Platform transparency | Ranking/visibility criteria must be published | Algorithm transparency required |
| Pricing | Cannot use predatory pricing | Minimum pricing floor exists |
| Dominant position | Abuse of dominance actively prosecuted | If Diyafa gains >50% share, heightened scrutiny |

### 6.2 Auto-Entrepreneur Status for Drivers

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Revenue cap (services) | MAD 200,000/year |
| Revenue cap (goods) | MAD 500,000/year |
| Tax rate (services) | 1% flat on turnover |
| Tax rate (commercial) | 0.5% flat on turnover |

| VAT registration threshold | MAD 500,000 turnover | Below = exempt |
| Digital VAT filing | Via SIMPL-TVA portal | Electronic filing mandatory |

### 6.4 Data Protection (CNDP -- Law 09-08)

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Governing body | CNDP (Commission Nationale de controle de la protection des Donnees) |
| Applicable law | Law No. 09-08 (2009) |
| Standard processing | Prior declaration to CNDP required |
| High-risk processing | Prior authorization from CNDP required |

## 7. Technology Stack Recommendations

### 7.1 Mapping and GPS

| Solution | Suitability for Morocco | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|------|-------|
| **Google Maps Platform** | Excellent coverage | $7/1000 requests (Directions) | Best street-level data for Moroccan cities; includes traffic |
| **Mapbox** | Good coverage | $0.50/1000 requests | Customizable maps; good for driver app |
| **OpenStreetMap (via GraphHopper)** | Good base | Free (self-hosted) or paid API | Local contributors map shortcuts; good medina coverage |
| **OpenRouteService** | Good | Free tier available | Built on OSM; route optimization included |

**Recommendation:** Use Google Maps for customer-facing (best UX and accuracy) and OpenStreetMap/GraphHopper for backend routing optimization (cost savings at scale). Morocco's Google Maps coverage is solid for all major cities.

**Morocco-specific mapping challenges:**
- Medina areas have narrow streets/alleys not always in Google Maps
- OSM often has better medina coverage due to local contributors
- New developments (e.g., Technopolis, new Casablanca districts) may have gaps
- Consider hybrid: Google Maps for display + OSM for routing in medina zones

### 7.2 Real-Time Tracking

| Technology | Use Case | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| WebSocket (Socket.io) | Live location streaming | Primary for driver tracking |
| Firebase Realtime Database | Order status updates | Good for cross-platform sync |
| MQTT | Lightweight location pings | Better for low-bandwidth areas |
| Background location (native) | Driver app GPS collection | Every 10-15 seconds |

**Architecture:**
```
Driver App --> MQTT/WebSocket --> Location Service --> Redis (cache)
                                                  --> PostgreSQL (history)
                                                  --> Customer App (live map)
```

### 7.3 Communication Stack

| Channel | Use Case | Implementation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **WhatsApp Business API** | Primary driver communication, order notifications, customer support | WhatsApp is THE communication app in Morocco; integrate via official API or providers like CEQUENS, Go4WhatsUp |
| SMS (via ComPeak/TextPeak) | Fallback for non-WhatsApp users, OTP verification | ~0.03-0.05 MAD per SMS |
| Push notifications | Order updates, driver assignments | Firebase Cloud Messaging |
| In-app chat | Driver-customer communication during delivery | Custom implementation |

**WhatsApp is non-negotiable for Morocco.** It is the primary communication channel for both personal and business use. All driver notifications, order updates, and support should flow through WhatsApp first.

### 7.4 Offline-Capable Driver App

**Critical for Morocco** -- connectivity varies significantly between urban cores and peripheral areas.

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Offline order queue | Local SQLite/WatermelonDB + background sync |
| Offline maps | Pre-cached map tiles for assigned zones |
| Offline GPS tracking | Local storage + batch upload on reconnect |
| Offline order completion | Queue completion events, sync when online |
| Low-bandwidth mode | Compressed data, text-only mode |
| 2G compatibility | Target <500KB initial load, progressive enhancement |

**Technical approach:**
- React Native or Flutter for cross-platform (Android priority -- 85%+ market share in Morocco)
- PWA as fallback for low-end devices
- Background Sync API for queued actions
- IndexedDB/SQLite for local persistence
- Delta sync (only send changes, not full state)

### 7.5 Competitor Technology Analysis

**Glovo's stack (reference architecture):**

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Mobile apps | Flutter + React Native |
| Backend | Node.js + Python microservices |
| Databases | PostgreSQL + MongoDB |
| Cache | Redis |
| Real-time | Socket.io + Firebase |
| Maps | Google Maps API + Mapbox |
| Cloud | AWS with Docker containerization |
| Architecture | Migrating monolith to microservices |
| Order matching | Real-time algorithm (proximity + availability + performance + vehicle type) |
| Scaling | Containerized auto-scaling; processes 100K+ daily orders globally |

**Diyafa advantage:** Diyafa already has a robust Next.js + tRPC + Supabase stack. Extending this with:
- Supabase Realtime for live tracking (already available)
- Supabase Edge Functions for driver matching
- PostGIS for geospatial queries
- Supabase Auth for driver authentication

This avoids the need for a completely separate tech stack and leverages existing infrastructure.

### 7.6 Recommended Diyafa Delivery Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Driver app (Android) | React Native | Cross-platform; offline-first; 85%+ Android market |
| Driver app (iOS) | React Native | Same codebase |
| Real-time tracking | Supabase Realtime + WebSocket | Already in stack; PostGIS for geo |
| Order matching | Supabase Edge Functions + Redis | Low-latency; proximity-based |
| Maps (customer) | Google Maps JavaScript API | Best UX for Morocco |
| Maps (routing) | GraphHopper (OSM) | Cost-effective routing at scale |
| Payments (cards) | CMI integration | Mandatory for Moroccan cards |
| Payments (COD) | Custom module | Cash reconciliation system |
| Payments (wallets) | Payzone API | Mobile wallet support |
| Communication | WhatsApp Business API | Primary channel in Morocco |
| SMS | ComPeak/TextPeak | OTP + fallback |
| Push | Firebase Cloud Messaging | Standard |
| Anti-fraud | SHIELD + custom ML | Device fingerprinting + behavior |
| KYC | Smile ID or uqudo | Morocco-specific ID verification |
| Analytics | Existing analytics module | Extend for delivery metrics |

## 8. Strategic Recommendations for Diyafa

### 8.1 Market Entry Strategy

**Why now is the right time:**

1. **Jumia Food exit (Dec 2023)** created a vacuum that local players are only partially filling
2. **Glovo antitrust settlement (Jul 2025)** forced transparency and commission caps, leveling the playing field
3. **Rider dissatisfaction with Glovo** (Sep 2025 strike) means a pool of 4,500 couriers open to alternatives
4. **Diyafa already has 6,500+ restaurant relationships** (matching Glovo's partner count) through its existing menu platform
5. **Competition Council is receptive** to new entrants that increase competition
6. **Delivery Hero consolidation** may cause organizational disruption at Glovo

### 8.2 Competitive Positioning

**Diyafa differentiators vs. Glovo:**

| Dimension | Glovo | Diyafa Opportunity |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Commission rate | Capped at 30% | Offer 15-20% (undercut significantly) |
| Driver base rate | 6 MAD/delivery | Offer 10-12 MAD/delivery |
| Restaurant relationship | Transactional | Already embedded via menu platform |
| Cash handling | Standard | Integrated with Cash Plus/WafaCash network |
| Technology | Monolith-to-microservice migration | Modern stack from day one |
| Local identity | Spanish/German parent | Position as "Moroccan-built" |
| Transparency | Forced by regulator | Proactive transparency as brand value |
| Driver welfare | Minimal investment + strike response | Scholarship fund + accident insurance from launch |
| Exclusivity | Banned by settlement | Multi-platform friendly |

### 8.3 City Launch Priority

| Priority | City | Population | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Casablanca | 3.7M | Largest market, highest order volume, most restaurants |
| 2 | Rabat-Sale | 1.9M | Government/business center, high purchasing power |
| 3 | Marrakech | 1.0M | Tourist + local demand; Diyafa likely has strong restaurant base |
| 4 | Tangier | 1.1M | Growing economy, port city, young population |
| 5 | Fes | 1.2M | Large city but complex medina logistics |
| 6 | Agadir | 0.6M | Tourist destination, spread-out city |
| 7 | Meknes | 0.6M | Growing market |
| 8 | Kenitra | 0.4M | Emerging city with good infrastructure |

### 8.4 Revenue Model

| Revenue Stream | Rate | Notes |
|---------------|------|-------|
| Restaurant commission | 15-20% | Below Glovo's 30% cap; major differentiator |
| Delivery fee (customer) | 10-15 MAD | Distance-based |
| Surge delivery premium | 1.2-2.0x multiplier | Dynamic, capped at 2x |
| Featured restaurant placement | 500-2000 MAD/month | Promoted listings |
| Advertising | CPM-based | In-app restaurant ads |
| Subscription (Pro restaurant) | Existing Diyafa tiers | Bundle delivery with menu platform |
| Data insights | Premium | Restaurant analytics package |

### 8.5 Critical Success Factors

1. **COD-first payment architecture** -- Cash on delivery must work flawlessly from day one
2. **WhatsApp-native communication** -- All notifications and support via WhatsApp
3. **Driver welfare as brand** -- Fair pay + insurance + scholarship differentiates from Glovo
4. **Medina-optimized routing** -- Solve the old city navigation problem competitors struggle with
5. **Ramadan readiness** -- Build for the extreme iftar demand spike from day one
6. **Arabic-first UI** -- RTL support and Darija-friendly interface (Diyafa already has AR support)
7. **Offline resilience** -- Driver app must work in spotty connectivity
8. **30% lower commissions** -- The Glovo settlement number is now the ceiling; come in well under it

### 8.6 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Glovo/Delivery Hero retaliatory pricing | High | High | Ensure pricing is sustainable, not predatory; document compliance |
| Driver cash theft (COD) | High | Medium | Daily settlement, caps, progressive trust, mobile wallet incentives |
| Regulatory complexity (BAM license) | Medium | High | Partner with licensed payment institution initially |
| Low average order values squeezing margins | High | High | Optimize operations for efficiency; seek volume over margin |
| Rider poaching by Glovo | Medium | Medium | Driver loyalty programs, better pay, brand community |
| CNDP data protection complaints | Low | Medium | Proactive compliance; appoint DPO; register with CNDP |
| Food safety incidents | Medium | High | Require ONSSA registration; temperature complaint tracking |
| GPS spoofing / fraud | Medium | Medium | Device fingerprinting + location intelligence from launch |

---

## Data Quality Assessment
