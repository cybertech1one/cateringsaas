## 1. Executive Summary

The global catering services market is valued at approximately **$129.77 billion in 2025** and is projected to reach **$311.87 billion by 2034** at a **6.6% CAGR**. The catering *software* market specifically is estimated at **$1.12-2.0 billion in 2025**, growing at **12.3-15% CAGR** to reach **$2.84-6.0 billion by 2033**.

The market is dominated by a handful of players across two distinct models:
- **Marketplace model** (ezCater): Takes 15-18% commission per transaction; processed $2.5B+ in orders in 2024
- **SaaS subscription model** (Caterease, CaterTrax, Total Party Planner): $57-450/month recurring revenue

Key findings:
- **86% of caterers report being understaffed**; software that reduces labor needs wins
- **75% of catering orders now occur online**; mobile-first is mandatory
- **53% of corporate buyers plan to increase catering budgets**
- **No dominant player exists in MENA/Morocco**; the market is wide open
- **AI is the next battleground**: demand forecasting, waste reduction (up to 39%), dynamic pricing, and automated proposal generation are emerging differentiators
- The optimal revenue model for a Morocco launch is a **hybrid** (low SaaS fee + moderate commission) to overcome the region's price sensitivity

| Pros | Zero barrier to entry for caterers; revenue scales automatically |

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| How it works | Monthly/annual recurring fee per user or tier |

## 6. Market Gaps & Opportunities

### 6.1 What Customers Complain About

Based on reviews across G2, Capterra, BBB, Trustpilot, and SoftwareAdvice:

**Caterer/Restaurant Pain Points:**
1. **Commission rates too high** - ezCater's 15-18% eats into already thin margins (food service margins typically 3-9%)
2. **Platform dependency** - Caterers feel "held hostage"; profiles deleted without recourse
3. **Poor mobile experiences** - Multiple platforms have weak or nonexistent mobile apps
4. **Dated UI/UX** - Caterease, CaterTrax criticized for looking like 2010-era software
5. **Steep learning curves** - Enterprise tools require weeks of training
6. **No online ordering** - Better Cater, some Caterease plans lack this critical feature
7. **Opaque pricing** - CaterTrax, Caterease, Priava all hide pricing
8. **Setup fees** - $500-1,000 upfront fees discourage small businesses
9. **No Apple/Mac support** - Caterease specifically
10. **Software reliability** - Reports of frequent crashes and bugs

**Buyer/Corporate Pain Points:**
1. **Limited dietary/allergen management** - Growing demand, weak supply of features
2. **No real-time tracking** - 97% want delivery updates; most platforms don't offer it
3. **Poor personalization** - 71% of employees want ordering input; platforms are one-size-fits-all
4. **Lack of recurring order management** - Weekly meal programs are booming but poorly supported

### 6.2 What Is Missing in the Market

| Gap | Opportunity | Competitive Advantage |
|-----|-------------|----------------------|
| **MENA/Arabic-first platform** | No major catering SaaS serves MENA natively with Arabic RTL | FeastQR already has Arabic i18n + RTL |
| **AI-native catering** | Most platforms bolt on AI; none are AI-first | Build AI into the core (forecasting, proposals, pricing) |
| **Mobile-first design** | Most platforms are web-first with weak mobile | React Native or PWA with offline support |
| **Integrated delivery** | Catering + delivery logistics in one platform | FeastQR already building delivery module |
| **Sustainability tracking** | 52% shifted to sustainable practices; no tools exist | Carbon footprint, waste tracking, sustainable sourcing |
| **Real-time order tracking** | 97% of buyers want it; only ezCater partially offers it | FeastQR already has order tracking |
| **Multi-language menus** | No catering platform supports FR/AR natively | FeastQR has EN/FR/AR with auto-translation |
| **Low-cost entry** | Most platforms cost $100-450/month; prohibitive for MENA SMBs | Freemium + affordable Pro tier in MAD |
| **COD support** | 60-74% of Morocco transactions are COD; no platform handles this | FeastQR already has COD payment flow |
| **WhatsApp integration** | Dominant communication channel in MENA; no catering SaaS uses it | FeastQR has WhatsApp ordering + notifications |
| **Batch production planning** | Caterers need it; few platforms offer it | Kitchen management + batch optimization |
| **Event + Catering unified** | Either event-focused (Tripleseat) or catering-focused (CaterTrax), never both | Build a unified event + catering + delivery platform |

### 6.3 Where Innovation Is Happening

1. **AI-powered demand forecasting** - Predicting order volumes before events
2. **Dynamic pricing algorithms** - Adjusting prices by daypart and demand
3. **Computer vision for waste reduction** - Cutting food waste by 39%

- CaterTrax = Enterprise/institutional, English-only
- Caterease = Dated legacy software, no Arabic
- Tripleseat = Venue/event focused, premium pricing, no MENA presence
- Foodics = POS/restaurant focused, not catering-specific
