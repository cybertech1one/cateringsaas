### 1.3 Catering Market Sizing (Estimated)

There is no single published report sizing Morocco's catering market specifically. Based on cross-referencing multiple data points, here is a bottoms-up estimate:

**Wedding Catering Segment:**
- Estimated 200,000-250,000 weddings/year in Morocco (based on population, marriage rate of ~5.5 per 1000)
- Average catering spend: MAD 30,000-150,000 per wedding (MAD 100-500 per guest x 300-500 guests)
- Mid-range estimate: MAD 75,000 average catering spend per wedding
- **Estimated wedding catering market: MAD 15-18.75 billion ($1.5-1.9B)**

**Corporate Catering Segment:**
- Growing tech sector, 200+ premium conference venues across Morocco
- Corporate events, MICE tourism, co-working space catering
- **Estimated corporate catering: MAD 2-3 billion ($200-300M)**

**Religious/Cultural Events (Ramadan, Eid, holidays):**
- Ramadan iftar catering (corporate + family)
- Eid celebrations, circumcision ceremonies, engagement parties
- **Estimated religious/cultural catering: MAD 3-5 billion ($300-500M)**

**Hotel/Riad/Tourism Catering:**
- 17.4M tourists, 28.7M overnight stays
- Destination weddings, tourist events, culinary tourism
- **Estimated tourism-related catering: MAD 1-2 billion ($100-200M)**

**Total Addressable Market (TAM) Estimate: MAD 21-29 billion ($2.1-2.9B)**

> **Confidence:** Medium. These are estimates derived from publicly available data. The informal nature of most catering businesses in Morocco (83% of businesses are informal per World Bank) means actual market activity is likely larger than formal records suggest.

### 1.4 Catering Activity by City

| City | Population | Catering Demand Drivers | Relative Market Size |
|------|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Casablanca** | 3.7M metro | Business capital, corporate events, largest wedding market, trade fairs | Largest (est. 30-35%) |
| **Marrakech** | 1.3M metro | Tourism capital, destination weddings, hotel/riad events, festivals (Gnawa, etc.) | 2nd largest (est. 20-25%) |
| **Rabat** | 1.9M metro | Government events, diplomatic functions, growing tech scene, universities | 3rd (est. 12-15%) |
| **Tangier** | 1.1M metro | Port city, growing tourism, Spanish-influenced cuisine, corporate (Renault, etc.) | Growing (est. 8-10%) |
| **Fes** | 1.2M metro | Cultural tourism, traditional cuisine capital, artisan events, riad catering | Moderate (est. 7-9%) |
| **Agadir** | 0.9M metro | Beach tourism, European visitors, resort events, surfing culture | Moderate (est. 5-7%) |
| **Meknes** | 0.8M metro | Agricultural hub, regional events, traditional celebrations | Smaller (est. 3-4%) |
| **Oujda** | 0.5M metro | Eastern Morocco, cross-border activity with Algeria | Smaller (est. 2-3%) |
| **Essaouira** | 0.08M | Niche tourism, boutique events, festivals (Gnaoua) | Small but high-value |

### 1.5 Types of Catering Services in Morocco

**By Service Model:**

1. **Traiteur traditionnel (Traditional caterer)** -- The dominant model. Individual caterers (often women) who cook for weddings and events from home kitchens or rented spaces. Operates almost entirely informally via word-of-mouth and WhatsApp.

2. **Traiteur professionnel (Professional caterer)** -- Registered businesses with commercial kitchens. Serve weddings, corporate events, and upscale occasions. Examples: H&S Traiteur (Rabat), Mosaic Traiteur (Marrakech), El Ouardi Traiteur (Marrakech).

3. **Hotel/Riad in-house catering** -- Hotels and riads offering catering as part of their event packages. Especially prominent in Marrakech and Fes.

4. **Event planning agencies with catering** -- Full-service agencies (MoroccoEvents, EventMorocco DMC, Party Maroc) that bundle catering with planning, decor, entertainment.

5. **Restaurant catering (takeaway/bulk)** -- Restaurants providing bulk orders for events. Common for corporate lunches, family gatherings.

6. **Street food catering** -- For informal events, food truck style. Growing trend in urban areas.

7. **Dark kitchen / cloud kitchen catering** -- Emerging model in Casablanca and Marrakech for volume orders.

---

## 2. Existing Players and Competitive Landscape

### 2.1 Catering-Specific Digital Platforms

**Current state: VIRTUALLY NONE exist.**

There is no known Moroccan catering SaaS platform, marketplace, or booking system comparable to what exists in Europe/US (CaterZen, ezCater, Feast, etc.). This is the core opportunity.

| Platform Type | Morocco Status | Comparable Elsewhere |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Catering marketplace/booking | Does NOT exist | ezCater (US), Feast (UK), Caterwings |
| Catering management SaaS | Does NOT exist | CaterZen, Total Party Planner, Caterease |
| Event catering aggregator | Does NOT exist | yhangry (UK), Kapoor Caterers (India) |
| Wedding vendor marketplace | Nascent / minimal | WeddingWire, The Knot, Zankyou |

### 2.2 Adjacent Digital Players in Morocco

**Food Delivery Platforms (NOT catering-focused):**

| Platform | Market Share | Catering Capability | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Glovo** | 58% of delivery users | None (meal delivery only) | 38 cities, 6,500+ partners |
| **Jumia Food** | 41% of delivery users | None | Pan-African, declining in some markets |
| **DONE** | Niche | None | Local Moroccan player |
| **Kaalix** | Niche | None | Local Moroccan player |
| **Kooul** | Emerging | None | Local Moroccan foodtech |
| **Terraa** | Emerging | Farm-to-table (not catering) | Fresh produce delivery |

> Key insight: None of these platforms handle bulk catering orders, event planning, or multi-day event food service. Their infrastructure is built for individual meal delivery, not 300-guest wedding catering.

**Event Planning Companies (not digital-first):**

| Company | Location | Digital Presence | Booking Method |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| MoroccoEvents | Marrakech, Casablanca | Basic website | Phone/email |
| EventMorocco DMC | Marrakech, Casablanca, Agadir | Website | Phone/email |
| Mosaic Traiteur & Events | Marrakech | Website + Instagram | WhatsApp/phone |
| H&S Traiteur | Rabat | Website + Instagram | WhatsApp/phone |
| El Ouardi Traiteur | Marrakech | Instagram (26K followers) | WhatsApp/DM |
| Party Maroc | Marrakech | Website | Phone/email |
| Hello Moments Co | Multiple cities | Website | Phone/email |
| Elixir Morocco | Multiple cities | Website | Phone/email |

## 3. Cultural and Market Specifics

| "Halal Maroc" label | Extended to cover catering/restoration services | Growing formalization |
| Certificate validity | 1 year, renewable with annual audit | Cost barrier for small caterers |
| Practical reality | 99%+ of caterers are halal by default | Platform does NOT need halal certification feature as priority |
| Tourist/export consideration | Formal certification matters for international clients | Feature for destination wedding caterers |

### 3.5 Moroccan Wedding Industry Deep Dive

The Moroccan wedding is the **single largest driver** of the catering market. Key characteristics:

**Scale:**
- Traditional Moroccan weddings host 300-1,000+ guests (sometimes 1,500+)
- Multi-day celebrations: henna night (Day 1), wedding ceremony (Day 2), sometimes Day 3 celebration
- Each day requires separate catering

**Cost Structure (Casablanca, mid-range):**

| Component | Cost Range (MAD) | % of Budget |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Venue (salle des fetes) | 30,000-150,000 | 20-25% |
| **Catering (traiteur)** | **40,000-200,000** | **25-35%** |
| Music/entertainment (orchestra/DJ) | 15,000-80,000 | 10-15% |
| Photography/videography | 5,000-30,000 | 5-8% |

- Average destination wedding budget: $20,000-$50,000+ (catering alone: $4,000-$10,000+ for 100 guests)
- Catering cost per guest for destination: $40-$100 per person
- Marrakech alone hosts thousands of destination weddings annually

## 4. Payment and Logistics

### 4.1 Payment Methods in Morocco

| Method | Market Share | Relevance to Catering | Notes |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Cash** | 74% of all transactions | DOMINANT for catering | Cultural preference, trust factor. Caterers prefer cash. |
| **Bank transfer (virement)** | Growing | Common for large deposits | Used by professional caterers for advance payments |
| **CMI card payments** | Growing rapidly | Limited for catering today | 200M+ card transactions processed in 2024. CMI monopoly ended May 2025; market opening. |
| **Mobile wallets** | 6% penetration (8M+ wallets) | Very limited | MarocPay, CMI Pay, Inwi Money, Orange Money. Growing fast. |
| **Contactless** | 75% of card transactions | Not yet for catering | Infrastructure growing at merchant level |
| **Cheque** | Declining | Used for large events | Formal caterers accept post-dated cheques |
| **Instant transfers** | 64,600/day avg (Dec 2024) | Emerging for deposits | 16M+ instant transactions in 2024 |

**Key Payment Insight for Platform Design:**
- Cash will remain dominant for catering for 3-5 years minimum
- Platform must support cash-on-delivery / cash-at-event as primary payment
- Deposit collection via bank transfer or card is the digitizable opportunity
- "Pay 30% deposit online, balance in cash at event" is the bridge model
- CMI market liberalization (May 2025) will bring new payment processors and lower fees
- Mobile wallet integration (MarocPay) is future-forward but not yet mainstream enough

### 4.2 Catering Logistics (Distinct from Food Delivery)

**Catering logistics is fundamentally different from meal delivery:**

| Dimension | Food Delivery | Catering |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Volume | 1-5 meals | 50-1,000+ portions |
| Transport | Motorcycle/bicycle | Van/truck |
| Equipment | Insulated bag | Chafing dishes, serving ware, tables, chairs |
| Setup required | None (drop at door) | 1-4 hours setup time |
| Temperature control | Basic hot/cold bag | Industrial warmers, cold storage |
| Staff | 1 rider | 3-50+ people (cooks, servers, cleaners) |
| Timeline | 30-60 minutes | Days/weeks of planning |
| Cleanup | None | Full cleanup post-event |
| Equipment rental | None | Tables, chairs, linens, china, glassware |

**Logistics Challenges Specific to Morocco:**

1. **Road infrastructure varies** -- Major cities are fine, but rural wedding venues can be hard to access
2. **Temperature extremes** -- Marrakech summers hit 40C+; cold chain for large quantities is challenging
3. **No standardized equipment rental** -- Each caterer owns or rents ad hoc
4. **Staff availability** -- Seasonal demand creates labor shortages during peak wedding season
5. **Venue coordination** -- Many event venues (salles des fetes) have their own rules about outside caterers
6. **Traffic in cities** -- Casablanca/Marrakech traffic can delay setup by hours

### 4.3 Legal and Regulatory Requirements

| Requirement | Authority | Status | Implication |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Food safety (Law 28-07) | ONSSA | Exists but poorly enforced | Opportunity for platform to add trust/verification |
| Business registration | Regional Investment Center (CRI) | Required but 83% are informal | Platform can help formalize |
| Health authorization (Order 244-13) | Ministry of Agriculture | Required for non-retail food service | Major barrier for small caterers |
| HACCP certification | IMANOR | Optional but growing | Differentiator for professional caterers |
| Halal certification | IMANOR | Optional (default halal) | Not priority for domestic market |
| Tax registration (IS/IR) | DGI (Tax authority) | Required | Informal sector avoids this |
| Employee social security (CNSS) | CNSS | Required for formal employees | Event staff often informal |
| Commercial lease registration | OMPIC | For commercial kitchens | Relevant for dark kitchen caterers |

**Key regulatory insight:** ONSSA's food safety framework is "robust on paper" but "reach into the catering and street food sector remains extremely limited." This means a platform that provides quality verification and hygiene standards could become a de facto trust signal, filling the enforcement gap.

1. **FIFA 2030 World Cup** -- Morocco is co-hosting. $5-6B in infrastructure investment. 100,000+ new hotel beds. 26M tourist target by 2030. This will MASSIVELY increase demand for professional catering services and create pressure to formalize/digitize the sector.

2. **Tourism boom** -- 17.4M visitors in 2024 (record), up 20% YoY. Target: 19M in 2025. Tourism revenue: MAD 112B. Destination weddings and event tourism growing fast.

3. **Urbanization** -- 66% urban, growing to 77% by 2050. Urban populations demand more formalized services.

4. **Young, digital-native population** -- 42.4% under 25, median age 30.8. This generation expects to book everything online.

5. **Digital Morocco 2030 Strategy** -- Government push for digitalization launched September 2024.

6. **Payment infrastructure modernization** -- CMI monopoly ended May 2025, instant payments growing (16M+ transactions in 2024), mobile wallets expanding.

7. **Growing middle class and consumer spending** -- Household disposable income up 6.7% to MAD 1.06 trillion in 2024. Domestic demand drove 5.4% GDP growth in late 2024.

8. **E-commerce acceleration** -- 65% increase in online shoppers since 2019. $3.5B market projected by 2029.

**Sector-Specific Drivers:**

9. **Informality creates opportunity** -- 83% of businesses are informal. A platform that helps formalize (tax compliance, contracts, payments) can partner with government incentives.

10. **No incumbent to displace** -- No existing catering platform means organic growth, not competitive displacement.

11. **WhatsApp fatigue** -- Managing 50+ client conversations via WhatsApp is unsustainable at scale. Caterers want better tools.

12. **Quality trust deficit** -- No review/rating system for caterers means customers take big risks on expensive events. A review platform solves this instantly.

13. **Moroccan wedding market is enormous** -- 200,000+ weddings/year, MAD 15-19B in catering alone.

### 6.3 Key Pain Points a Platform Could Solve

| Pain Point | Platform Solution | Value Proposition |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **"How do I find a good traiteur?"** | Searchable directory with reviews, ratings, photos, menus | Reduce discovery time from weeks to minutes |
| **"How much should this cost?"** | Transparent pricing, per-guest estimates, instant quotes | Eliminate price gouging and opacity |
| **"Can I trust this caterer?"** | Verified reviews, food safety badges, portfolio gallery | De-risk the biggest event investment |
| **"My WhatsApp is chaos"** | Centralized booking dashboard, calendar, notifications | Professional operations for caterers |
| **"I can't scale my business"** | Online presence, SEO, social sharing, lead generation | Growth engine for caterers |
| **"Cash flow is unpredictable"** | Online deposit collection, payment tracking, invoicing | Financial stability for caterers |
| **"Menu planning is manual"** | Digital menu builder, per-guest scaling, dietary filters | Save hours per event |
| **"I can't manage my staff"** | Staff scheduling, assignment, communication tools | Scale staffing for events |
| **"I don't know my numbers"** | Analytics: revenue, bookings, popular items, seasonal trends | Data-driven business decisions |
| **"I'm not formalized"** | Tax reporting, digital contracts, compliance tools | Bridge to formal sector |

### 6.4 Willingness to Pay

**For Caterers (B2B SaaS):**

| Tier | Target | Monthly Price (MAD) | Justification |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Free | New/informal caterers | 0 | Basic listing, limited bookings. Funnel for premium. |
| Starter | Small caterers (1-5 events/month) | 99-199 MAD ($10-20) | 1-2 average event profits covers annual cost |
| Pro | Professional caterers (5-20 events/month) | 299-499 MAD ($30-50) | Menu builder, analytics, unlimited bookings |
| Enterprise | Event agencies, hotel caterers | 999-1999 MAD ($100-200) | Multi-location, team management, API access |

> Morocco context: Average restaurant POS subscription is $20-50/month. Caterers with higher ticket sizes (MAD 30,000+ per event) can justify higher SaaS costs. A platform that brings even ONE additional booking/month pays for itself many times over.

**Commission Model (Marketplace):**

| Model | Rate | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Booking fee | 3-5% per booking | Charged to caterer on confirmed bookings |
| Payment processing | 1.5-2.5% | When payment flows through platform |
| Premium listing | MAD 199-499/month | Featured placement in search |
| Lead generation | MAD 20-50 per qualified lead | Pay-per-inquiry model |

### 6.5 Potential Barriers and Challenges

| Barrier | Severity | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Cash preference** | HIGH | Support cash tracking; digitize deposits first, full payments later |
| **Informal sector resistance** | HIGH | Start with benefits (leads, visibility) not compliance pressure |
| **Low tech literacy (older caterers)** | HIGH | Mobile-first, Arabic/French UI, WhatsApp integration |
| **Trust building** | HIGH | Start in 1-2 cities, build reputation organically |
| **Cultural negotiation norms** | MEDIUM | Allow flexible pricing; quotes not fixed prices |
| **Low SaaS awareness** | MEDIUM | Freemium model; demonstrate ROI with first booking |
| **Seasonal demand** | MEDIUM | Year-round features (menu planning, marketing) to maintain engagement |
| **Payment processing fees** | MEDIUM | Partner with CMI competitors post-liberalization for better rates |
| **Venue exclusivity agreements** | LOW | Some venues mandate in-house catering; platform can still serve those caterers |
| **Internet reliability in rural areas** | LOW | Offline-capable PWA for event day |

**The opportunity is clear: There is a massive gap where a digitally mature, catering-specific platform should exist in Morocco. Diyafa can fill this gap.**
